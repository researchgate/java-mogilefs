Java client library for MogileFS (http://www.danga.com/mogilefs/). Code
is mostly a copy of the perl client.

This is a fork of eml's MogileFS Java client with fixes pulled from ash2k and 
davidheldon's tree. 

This branch has the following improvements:

- list_keys MogileFS support.
- Java Generics.
- SLF4J Logging, no hard dependency on Log4J.
- JUnit testing. 
- Merged bug fixes from ash2k and davidheldon's forks. 

Choose one of the classes in com.guba.mogilefs that implements
the MogileFS interface:

SimpleMogileFSImpl - simplest implementation that holds a single
	connection to a mogile tracker. Shouldn't be used by
	multiple threads.
PooledMogileFSImpl - thread safe implementation that keeps a pool of
	connections open to the mogile trackers. Excellent for
	servlets to share.
LocalFileMogileFSImpl - this implementation doesn't actually talk
	to mogile servers - it just acts like it, but stores things
	locally. Its useful it you want to test something locally
	or have a fake local mogile store.

Please send bug reports to Victor Igumnov <victori@fabulously40.com>.
